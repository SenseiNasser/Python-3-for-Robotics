
# Python is the most popular programming language for robots
# together with C++
# Many of the artificial intelligence libraries used for robotics are written in Python (e.g. OpenCV, ROS, PyTorch, TensorFlow, etc.)
# ROS (Robot Operating System) is a set of software libraries and tools that help you build robot applications
# ROS is a framework for writing robot software.
# ROS is a collection of tools, libraries and conventions that aim to simplify the task of creating complex and robust robot behavior across a wide variety of robotic platforms.
# ROS language is Python and C++
# you want to become a ROS developer, you need to learn Python and C++

# This files is exersices for learning Python with ROS


# Learning Goals :
# How to store data into variables
# How to operate with the data in the variables
# How to change behavior based on conditions
# How to create methods that can be called from other places of the code
# How to encapsulate the code into classes so you can have clean and robust code

# Robot Used with these Exercises Summit XL & Turtlebot
